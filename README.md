Microsoft -Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents

Overview
---------
Welcome to the Microsoft Classification Project! This project aims to build a robust classification model to detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we strive to enhance fraud detection capabilities and contribute to more secure financial operations.

Features
---------
- Data Processing: Comprehensive preprocessing and cleaning of financial transaction data.
- Algorithm Implementation: Utilizes multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Thorough evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fraud Detection: Aims to identify suspicious transactions and flag them for further review.
